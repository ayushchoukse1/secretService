[[overview]]
= Overview
****
The secret service API can be used by a user to create secrets of his own. Rest calls are made to perform any operation with the API.
The following are the operations a user can perform:

.Operations
* Create a user Account.
	- User authority is provided by default on account creation.
* Get authorization with the API.
	- Get access token to make further operations on the resources.
* Update, and delete the user account details.
	- Only the user can perform these operations on its account.
	- Authorization token is needed in order to perform these operations.
	- No other user can see your account details, update or delete it.
* Create, update, and delete a secret. 
	- After getting authorized, a user can create a secret, and perform further operations on a secrete by providing access token in the header.
	- All the secrets are by default encrypted in database. 
	- No other user can access, delete or update your secret.
	- User with Administrator rights also cannot see any secrets created by any other user.

NOTE: A user will be provided access token with time validity, after authorizing with API. Access token must be saved in a secured place.
The access token provided must be provided in the header fields using "Authorization" header.
